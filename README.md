# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

**Introduction: **

* Bitcoin has had a volatile trading history from 2014 to 2021. It remained stable until late 2017 when it experienced a meteoric rise and reached record highs, with some exchanges having the price of a single bitcoin at approximately 20,000 U.S. dollars. However, prices soon started to tumble in the months that followed. In 2018 and 2019, Bitcoin entered a period of stagnation, when its price started to range significantly. Though influenced by the coronavirus in 2020, the price still kept stable and reached $28,000 at the end of the year. In the first quarter of 2021, Bitcoin was worth over 60,000 USD after the Bitcoin price surged due to Tesla investing 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in the cryptocurrency. 

**Conclusion: **

* With prediction, the growth trend can be expected to continue in the late 2021. The Bitcoin may be worth over 63,000 USD in the following months.
